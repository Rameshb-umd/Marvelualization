In the mighty world of comics, book publishers like DC Comics and Marvel Comics hold a
combined market share of almost 70% ( R. Johnston, 2016 ). The competition between these two
comic book publishers has given birth to thousands of new characters that attracts wider
audience and also targeted demographics. As a result, there is an exponential increase in the
quantity of data in the world of comics which originated in the early 1930’s. The rapid increase
in quantity of data and it's time-oriented nature adds to the complexity.
Comic lovers now span across multiple generations and face a big challenge in comprehending
the origin and history of a character which they start to follow. Typically these fans are not
computer experts and require an easy-to-use application that provides narrative visualization by
consuming the time-oriented bland categorical data from multiple sources and provides users
with direct manipulation that aides in interactive storytelling. Despite interactive visualization
being a well-known method to analyze large dynamic datasets, Silva, S. F., & Catarci, T.
(2000) observed that enough research had not been conducted on understanding the relationship
between the visual techniques and complex time-oriented data. Lu, A., & Shen, H. W. (2008,
March) proposed a solution to this problem by developing an interactive storyboard approach
that integrates automatic visualization generation methods and interactive adjustment procedures
to visualize these time-varying datasets.
